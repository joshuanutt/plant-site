** In so far as 'monkey grass' is often the terminology used for liriope, then yes, which is confusing since mondo grass is also called 'monkey grass' and yet liriope and mondo grass are not the same at all. In fact, they aren't even grasses.

Mondo grass plants are typically shorter than monkey grass, and may be darker green.
The leaves of mondo grass are more narrow than those of monkey grass.

> Plants are light green in full sun but deeper green in shade

> Mondo grass care is extremely minimal, but you do need to choose the correct site and prepare the bed for best results. Either location works well provided soil is well draining and free of competitive weeds.

> If you are growing mondo grass as a lawn, there is little you need to maintain it. Remove any weeds as they appear and keep the area moist in the dry season. After winter storms, leaves may be ragged and can be trimmed back a bit for best appearance. 

> Mondo grass needs very little fertilizing. A once-annual feeding in spring with a diluted grass feed is sufficient.
